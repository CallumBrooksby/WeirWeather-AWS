# WeirWeather

This repository is for the WeirWeather Automatic Weather Station project which provides live weather measurements from the James Weir buidling in Glasgow, co-ordinates: [55.862809, -4.245339]. This repository contains all of the software, CAD models, BOMs and EAGLE PCB files required to reproduce the weather station and the website we have created.

This project was completed for a Masters group project at the University of Strathclyde Electrical & Electronic Engineering Department.
